# Folder Contents

This folder will hold stuff that is completely unrelated to the code compilation and has nothing to do with the main algorithm. However, this folder will hold all sorts of tools and utilities for plotting results, plotting tests, running examples, tutorials, and other things like that.

It is completely optional whether to download this folder or not, and each user is free to decide on their own. The documentation does mention tools and examples that are included in this folder, so just be aware of that.

## Folder Structure

Currently there are only some random input files. I will work on this closer to publication to include some examples of how the code works.
