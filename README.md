# BtB-MCR

BtB-MCR is a repository dedicated to fast digital material reconstruction techniques. The repository will serve as a collection of already existing algorithms for digital microstructure reconstruction (MCR) while also serving as testing ground for novel implementations and novel algorithms, with the mission of increased robustness and faster computational speeds.

I will also include documentation and examples as more of this code becomes public.
