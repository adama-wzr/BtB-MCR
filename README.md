# BtB-MCR

BtB-MCR is a repository dedicated to fast digital material reconstruction techniques. The repository will serve as a collection of already existing algorithms for digital microstructure reconstruction (MCR) while also serving as testing ground for novel implementations and novel algorithms, with the mission of increased robustness and faster computational speeds.

I will also include documentation and examples as more of this code becomes public. Everything that is currently included in this package has been peer-reviewed and published already. Novel material will be indicated.

## Requirements

Linux requires MPI, while the Windows distribution relies on OpenMP for parallel computing. Below is a general list of requirements:

- GNU C/C++ compiler prefered.
- C++ 17 or later
- CMake 3.10 or later

GPU support will come to Linux at some point in the future. There are currently no plans to support Mac users, the package focuses on HPC applications.

### GUI Requirements

A GUI is coming in the future. There are different requirements for compiling the GUI.

## Compiling

Use the CMake files for building the application.


## Main Capabilities

Current capabilities:

- CPU accelerated material reconstruction via correlation functions (Y-T algorithm).
-

## Upcoming Changes

- 2D and 3D YTA code, enabled for multi-phase reconstruction.
- Parallel programming with MPI (UNIX exclusive, no Windows).
- Stochastic reconstruction methods will be implemented to the main execution loop.

- A genConfig GUI will be added soon. I learned my lesson with larger projects, it is definitely necessary. I have had bad experiences with Qt, so I will try a GTK-based GUI next.


## Acknowledgements

This package is a culmination of many years of work. While the material reconstruction aspect was never the strict focus of any project/allocation, this was a necessary auxiliary step of many projects. The development was made possible by the following allocations:
